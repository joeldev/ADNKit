                    ADNKit is an Objective-C framework for building App.net iOS and OS X applications. The guiding design principles are:
                    - Simple and powerful API
                    - As much heavylifting as possible is done for you (aka, tons of convenience methods)
                    10- 0% App.net API and features support
                    - No external dependencies other than `AFNetworking`
